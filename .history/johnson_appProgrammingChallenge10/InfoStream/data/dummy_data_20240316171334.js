    "Brighter, cheaper blue light could revolutionize screen technology",
    "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2024/brighter-cheaper-blue.jpg",
    "A team of researchers from Northumbria, Cambridge, Imperial, and Loughborough universities has developed a new design for blue OLEDs, potentially leading to more efficient, longer-lasting, and cheaper TV and smartphone screens. Their study in Nature Materials introduces a light-emitting molecule with added shields that block destructive energy pathways, improving molecule interaction and efficiency. This innovation could significantly reduce energy consumption in devices, aligning with net zero targets, and addresses issues with the lifespan and efficiency of blue subpixels in OLED displays."

    "The European Parliament has approved a significant AI Act, making it a pioneer in global AI regulation. This legislation categorizes AI products based on risk levels, with stringent rules for high-risk applications in critical areas like healthcare, law enforcement, and others. It bans AI that threatens fundamental rights, particularly involving biometric data. The Act aims for \"human - centric\" AI governance and positions the EU as a leader in establishing trustworthy AI standards worldwide. It's not yet law but is expected to greatly influence global AI regulation, with companies preparing to align with its requirements."

    "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Starship-launch-SpaceX-20240315.jpg?w=640",
    "SpaceX's Starship had its third test flight from the Starbase facility, successfully reaching orbit but losing the spacecraft during reentry into Earth's atmosphere. This marks progress compared to previous failures. Starship, intended for missions to the Moon and potentially Mars, is vital for NASA's Artemis 3 lunar mission. SpaceX's rapid iteration approach is pushing the development of this powerful launch system, bringing it closer to operational readiness for significant space exploration missions."

    "TikTok creators are concerned about a proposed U.S. bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban. The House of Representatives passed the bill, which requires Chinese-owned ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok. Content creators argue that a ban would impact many who rely on the platform for income and community. TikTok's popularity and influence have surged, but concerns about user data security and Chinese government influence persist. The bill still needs Senate approval, and its future there is uncertain."

    "Indirect negotiations to secure a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict are set to resume in Qatar. Both parties are involved, with recent proposals aiming to establish a six-week truce. The complex three-stage plan involves prisoner exchanges and gradual steps towards a permanent cease-fire. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has labeled the proposal as unrealistic, focusing on military actions against Hamas. International concerns over humanitarian crises in Gaza are growing amidst the ongoing conflict."

    "Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced a bill to reduce the standard U.S. workweek from 40 to 32 hours, with employers prohibited from cutting pay and benefits. This change would mean workers could potentially have an extra day off each week. The bill is a response to technological advances in automation and AI, aiming to redistribute work hours without reducing income. Critics argue it could harm industries needing hands-on workers and increase costs for businesses. The bill faces significant opposition in Congress and its passage is uncertain."

    "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240316-russia-elections-ch-1033-84e5b8.jpg",
    "During Russia's presidential election, various protests were observed, including dye being poured into ballot boxes and attempted arson. Despite these acts, Vladimir Putin is expected to win his fifth term. The focus is on turnout and legitimate ballots to give the election an appearance of legitimacy. Opposition figure Alexei Navalny's death heightened tensions, and his supporters, led by his widow Yulia, continue to protest. The Kremlin views high voter turnout as an endorsement of Putin's policies, especially the war in Ukraine. The election has been criticized for lack of fairness and transparency."
